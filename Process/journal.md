## THE GREAT TREE - Make-A-Thing - Week 1

As someone who has created a game with Bitsy before, I wasn’t going into this completely blind. Despite the fact that I could really only design with 3 colours due to the limitations of vanilla Bitsy, everything else with the software and implementation went well. Using these tools that I had already used in the past, I wanted to create something that wasn’t too big but also had some immersiveness about it. With this, I had a couple of other reasons why I decided to create The Great Tree. For starters, I had been reading the Lord of the Rings over the Christmas break and was creatively inspired by the books, so my mind is in fantasy land for a lack of a better term. Because of this, I wanted to create my own little fantasy world, however due to the limited scope imposed I didn’t create one. The second reason for creating this game was that after class while talking to a group of classmates I had briefly mentioned that I am from the off-island of Montreal, which was then followed up with,”You live in the woods.” From these two situations, my mind then combined the two and decided upon the idea of climbing a great tree. In the Lord of the Rings, there are a lot of magical trees, and based on the fact that I apparently live in the woods I thought it would be fun to have magic trees in a garden in the woods that you would climb. This was generally speaking my first and only idea and I just went with it simply put. I had a really fun time designing the map, and that overall was the best part. Up until the actual game started, I didn’t really have an idea to make it into a gamified experience. In Bitsy, I had only learned about branching lists within dialogue, and item collection. Therefore, the small ideas that popped into my head about adding physics such as falling branches or avoiding obstacles or chasing a squirrel up the tree couldn’t be implemented. Therefore, the game is not really a challenge or a game per se but it is an interactive experience. Instead I just put the squirrel at the top of the tree and left it there for the player to interact with at the end of the game. The only “game” part about the game is that the player has to collect the acorn and give it to the squirrel in order to beat the game.

## DESIGN JOURNAL - Exploration Prototype - Week 1

While selecting which prototype I wanted to mess around with from Matthew's repetoire, I intially chose PurrrfectPizza, since the title sounded fun. But Unity was very mean to me since it said the files was 4 years old (outdated apparently) and wouldn't open. I'm not very happy with Unity. I'm not sure if I have to choose a game that's less than 4 years old since I only have the newest version of Unity on my computer. Since unfortunately we didn't get to finish our class exercise because, again, Unity :), I wanted to explore more the idea of collision and test out various things within Matthew's library of games (at least that's what I assumed we had to do for this journal).

Despite this minor setback, I would still love to test out different interactions, movements and collisions within Unity since I never got to finish or go through the full process of understanding how it works. Again, we love Unity :). Hopefully I can understand what went wrong for next time and I can affectively get a better grasp at how to use this program as I have never used it before this class and based on what I want to do in the future, it's kind of an essentially to learn at least the basics of how Unity works.

I also forgot how to put this entry at the top of the markdown file so I'm sorry Matthew if you are reading this I promise not to do it again. :/

## DESIGN JOURNAL - Exploration Prototype - Week 2

I made a game! I participated in the McGill Game Jam 2026 with Arielle, Jimmy, Hubert and Owen.

This was such a tiring process, but I am so happy of what we created in the end.

The theme of the Game Jam was The Hunt.

I was the lead game designer/prototyper. I was responsible for coming up with ideas for the type of game we created. We ended up creating a top-down boss rush game, where you played the role of The Fellmonger, a hunter-gatherer tasked with defeating The Luminaire and The Frightful.

Below is also a google doc of my design process, where I threw down a bunch of ideas and concepts, including moodboards for characters, boss and character mechanics, and even scrapped dialogue.

We started off the Jam by discussing various things that first came to mind when discussing the hunt. We discussed food, hunting, wolves, monsters, bow and arrows amongst various other ideas.

We then refined our ideas into a boss rush, and decided to keep or scope at a maximum of 2 bosses since we wouldn't have enough time to animate or program any more bosses.

I worked alongside Arielle and Owen to give them instructions and feedback on the artwork, since they were responsible for environmental and character art respectively.
I also worked alongside Hubert who was responsible for creating the soundtrack for the game, providing feedback on his sounds, mostly involving minor changes.

After the prototyping and game design process was done, I started to mess around with Unity a bit, and was asked to add some particle effects (Which was never implemented but oh well). It was fun to learn the process of how particles in Unity work.

On the last day, since all that was left was to polish the game, I added the first corridor room in Unity, and after that I was put in the programming chair since that was all that was largely left to do.

Now if you know me well enough, then you will know that programming doesn't come naturally to me. I suck at it. I couldn't tell you what a boolean is even though I've been taught it like 5 different times. It's bad. So I struggled a lot with understanding what I was to do at all. I also had a lot of issues with merging in GitHub, and then Jimmy told me to install Git and to push and pull through there instead, which didn't make sense since I'm not a CompSci student and didn't learn Git before, which was a whole process until I realized I was stupid and could just clone the repo through GitHub Desktop and merge there. I was sleep deprived don't blame me.
Thanks to Jimmy for his patience (Even though he still hates me for this), and Arielle for helping me with understanding the programming that I was instructed to do.

Moral of the story: Don't ask me to do the programming for your game. But the game is complete and works!
