## THE GREAT TREE - Make-A-Thing - Week 1

As someone who has created a game with Bitsy before, I wasn’t going into this completely blind. Despite the fact that I could really only design with 3 colours due to the limitations of vanilla Bitsy, everything else with the software and implementation went well. Using these tools that I had already used in the past, I wanted to create something that wasn’t too big but also had some immersiveness about it. With this, I had a couple of other reasons why I decided to create The Great Tree. For starters, I had been reading the Lord of the Rings over the Christmas break and was creatively inspired by the books, so my mind is in fantasy land for a lack of a better term. Because of this, I wanted to create my own little fantasy world, however due to the limited scope imposed I didn’t create one. The second reason for creating this game was that after class while talking to a group of classmates I had briefly mentioned that I am from the off-island of Montreal, which was then followed up with,”You live in the woods.” From these two situations, my mind then combined the two and decided upon the idea of climbing a great tree. In the Lord of the Rings, there are a lot of magical trees, and based on the fact that I apparently live in the woods I thought it would be fun to have magic trees in a garden in the woods that you would climb. This was generally speaking my first and only idea and I just went with it simply put. I had a really fun time designing the map, and that overall was the best part. Up until the actual game started, I didn’t really have an idea to make it into a gamified experience. In Bitsy, I had only learned about branching lists within dialogue, and item collection. Therefore, the small ideas that popped into my head about adding physics such as falling branches or avoiding obstacles or chasing a squirrel up the tree couldn’t be implemented. Therefore, the game is not really a challenge or a game per se but it is an interactive experience. Instead I just put the squirrel at the top of the tree and left it there for the player to interact with at the end of the game. The only “game” part about the game is that the player has to collect the acorn and give it to the squirrel in order to beat the game.
